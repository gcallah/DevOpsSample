# DevOpsSample

This is a sample repo to get students (and others) going with a DevOps project.

It is being built for the DevOps class at NYU Tandon, but usable anywhere!

This project should layout the basic structure of all projects for the DevOps
class.

**DevOps**: the practices and tools supporting those practices that allow
organizations to deliver reliable software that meets its users' needs rapidly
and repeatedly.

## Setup

To set up a new developer's environment, in the top-level directory, run:

`make dev_env`

To build  production, run:

`make prod`


## Requirements

1. Use workflow control.
1. Use version control.
1. Automate our documentation generation.
1. Automate our testing.
1. Automate code review.
1. Configure the system with code (infra-structure as code).
1. Automate our builds.
1. Use CI/CD to automate our deployment.
1. Learn how to containerize our application.
1. Contemplate monitoring.

## Design

Tools to acheive the above:

1. kanban
1. git
1. pydoc
1. nose, coverage, unittest
1. flake8
1. make
1. Travis CI
1. Docker
1. Status Cake

## Implmentation

We should develop *incrementally*, taking many small steps.

We should **make work visible**.

## Testing

We will write automated tests for all of our application code.
